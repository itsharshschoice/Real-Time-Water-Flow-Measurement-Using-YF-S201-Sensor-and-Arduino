# **Real-Time Water Flow Measurement Using YF-S201 Sensor and Arduino**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates a **Water Flow Measurement System** using an Arduino Uno and the YF-S201 water flow sensor. The system calculates the flow rate of water and the total volume of water that passes through a pipe. The measurements are displayed on a 16x2 LCD for easy monitoring.


## **Features**
- Real-time measurement of water flow rate in liters per hour (L/hr).
- Total water volume tracking.
- User-friendly interface with a 16x2 LCD display.
- Low-cost, efficient, and easy-to-build solution.
- Utilizes the Hall effect principle for accurate flow rate detection.


## **Components Used**

- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller for processing sensor data.
- **YF-S201 Water Flow Sensor**: Measures the flow of water using the Hall effect.
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Displays flow rate and volume.
- **Potentiometer**: Adjusts LCD brightness.
- **Breadboard**: Prototyping the circuit.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connects components.


## **System Overview**

### **Working Principle**
The YF-S201 water flow sensor uses the **Hall effect** to measure water flow. It contains a turbine wheel with a magnet. As water flows through the sensor:

1. The turbine rotates, generating pulses proportional to the flow rate.
2. Arduino reads these pulses to calculate:
   - Flow rate (in L/hr).
   - Total water volume.

### **Workflow**

1. **Input Data:** The water flow sensor generates pulses based on the flow.
2. **Processing:** Arduino processes the pulse data and calculates the flow rate and volume.
3. **Output:** The calculated values are displayed on the 16x2 LCD.
